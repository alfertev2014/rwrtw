# RWRTW template DSL

This document describes convenient DSL-like API to build and compose UI components in declarative way using TypeScript.

## Overview of Template DSL

**Template DSL** is an _internal DSL_ which allows to build component trees in a declarative way with strict type checking. "Internal" means that the DSL constructions are regular TypeScript expressions. So, TypeScript is the _host language_. The DSL's grammar, parsing, semantics and error handling are implemented as a TypeScript library with heavy use of type checking.

The following is the fragment of the Counter app example:

```typescript
el("div")(
  el("h1")("It Works!"),
  el("p", { class: "paragraph" }, ref(hello))("Hello world!"),
  el("button", {
    click: ev(handleClick),
    focus: ev(() => console.log("focus!")),
  })("Increment"),
  el("div")(ifElse(true, el("p")("Even!"), el("span")("Odd!"), ref(evenOdd))),
)
```

Or with abbreviations:

```typescript
div()(
  h1()("It Works!"),
  p({ class: "paragraph" }, ref(hello))("Hello world!"),
  button({
    click: ev(handleClick),
    focus: ev(() => console.log("focus!")),
  })("Increment"),
  div()(ifElse(true, p()("Even!"), span()("Odd!"), ref(evenOdd))),
)
```

The DSL contains building blocks for native HTML elements, primitives for conditional content and dynamic lists, and utilities for binding controllers to DOM-nodes. The DSL simplifies describing components and its composition. Content of components including DOM-trees, placeholders and dynamic lists can be build with higher level constructions. Components' lifecycle is handled under the hood.

## DSL primitives

There are the three primitive construction to build extended DOM trees:

- `el` - HTML element
- `plh` - placeholder
- `plhList` - dynamic list of placeholders
- `fr` - template fragment

Every DSL primitive function returns controller factory function with signature (place, context) => void. But a developer could not think about places and lifecycle at all when using these building blocks together. Expression composition hides those complex details from developers.

If we need to do some low-level imperative logic on different phases of component lifecycle, the `lc` primitive function is used to register lifecycle hooks.

There are the following helpers for convenient building and adjusting of HTML element:

- `attr` - attribute of HTML element
- `on` and `ev` - binding of event handler

These primitive functions allows to add some details to elements.

If we need access to real DOM nodes produced by DSL, the `ref` primitive functions is used as an escape hatch.

### HTML element

Native HTML elements can be built with `el` factory function. It is high-order function which accepts HTML-tag, configuration object with attributes, event listeners, and other handlers which are to be called in rendering phase. `el` returns other function which accepts multiple children.

These are some examples:

```typescript
// div element without children
el("div")()

// span element with 'highlighted' CSS-class and "Some text content" as text content
el("span", { class: "highlighted" })("Some text content")

// div element with h3 heading text and unordered list of items
el("div")(
  el("h3")("Heading"),
  el("ul", { class: "unordered-list" })(
    el("li", { class: "list-item" })("One"),
    el("li", { class: "list-item" })("Two"),
    el("li", { class: "list-item" })("Three"),
  ),
)

el("form", {
  novalidate: true,
  submit: ev((event) => {
    /* ....  */
  }),
})(
  el("div", { class: "form-field" })(
    el("label", { for: "username" })("Username:"),
    el("input", { type: "text", name: "username" })(),
  ),
  el("div", { class: "form-field" })(
    el("label", { for: "password" })("Password:"),
    el("input", { type: "password", name: "password" })(),
  ),
)
```

### Placeholder

Placeholders can be created with `plh` function which accepts arbitrary component function as initial content and a callback function to access to placeholder instance.

```typescript
let aPlaceholder: Placeholder

const content = el("div")(
  plh(el("div")("Some initial content"), (placeholder, context) => {
    aPlaceholder = placeholder
  }),
)

createRootPlaceholderAt(placeAtBeginningOf(document.body), content)

aPlaceholder.replaceContent(
  el("div")(
    "Some ",
    el("span", { class: "text-emphasize" })("modified"),
    " content",
  ),
)
```
